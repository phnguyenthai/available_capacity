**Problem Statement:**

Our e-commerce company employs an Auto Order System to generate Purchase Orders for procuring products from various vendors. This system calculates the Required Order Quantity (ROQ) and is managed by the Inventory Planning and Allocation team.

Despite the automation, there are always instances of failed orders, necessitating manual intervention by the SNOP and Inbound Control Tower Team. Consequently, we need to determine which fulfillment centers (FCs) have the available capacity to handle the remaining ROQ.

Thus, the core problem lies in identifying the available capacity across our entire FC network to accommodate the remaining ROQ effectively.
